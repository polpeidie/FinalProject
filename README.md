# Plugin Moodle

### Description
This project tries to implement a check-in system for students that integrates with Moodle, in a simple and concise way. To do so, we implement a system where students swipe a RFID card to check in and out of class.

This system is divided into three parts:
- Retrieving data from RFID card and generating/editing a .json file.
- _'Observing'_ any changes in the .json file and sending information to PHP script in Moodle.
- Managing attendance inside Moodle and automatically updating database.

From now on we will call each part, Arduino script[^1], Observer[^2] and PHP script[^3] respectively.
